    "## INTRODUCTION TO V-REP\n",
    "\n",
    "V-REP is a powerful 3D robot simulator, which features several versatile calculation modules (inverse kinematics, Physics/dynamics, collision detections, minimum distance calculations, path planning, etc.), a distributed control architecture (unlimited number of control scripts, threaded or non threaded), and several extension mechanisms (plug-ins, custom client application, etc.).It offers a multitude of functionalities that can be easily integrated and combined through an exhaustive API and script functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "V-REP is the tool for fast prototyping and verification, remote monitoring, fast algorithm development, robotics related education, and simulation of factory automation systems. A V-REP plug-in was specifically developed to allow an intuitive, easy and realistic Khepera robot simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "On V-REP's homepage the program is described as\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"the Swiss army knife among robot simulators: you won't find a simulator with more functions, features, or more elaborate APIs.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "V-REP's strength comes from several features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. V-REP provides a unified framework combining many powerful internal and external libraries that are often useful for robotics simulations.\n",
    "2. V-REP is highly extensible.\n",
    "3. V-REP is cross-platform, mostly open-source, and provides a free educational license.\n",
    "\n",
    "### INTERACTION WITH V-REP\n",
    "\n",
    "#### V-REP GUI INTERFACE\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"userInterface.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to interact with the V-REP simulator, they are through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. REGULAR V-REP API: These are all functions that can either be called directly from a custom C/C++ plugin or through a Lua embedded script.  V-REP functions and constants can easily be recognized from their \"sim\"- or \"_sim\"-prefix (e.g. sim.handleCollision)\n",
    "http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/helpFiles/en/apiOverview.htm\n",
    "\n",
    "2. REMOTE V-REP API: this  is how V-REP enables scripts and programs written in other languages (MATLAB, Java, Python, etc.) to interact with a V-REP simulation from an external application or a remote hardware (e.g. real robot, remote computer, etc.). The remote API functions are interacting with V-REP via socket communication (or, optionally, via shared memory) in a way that reduces lag and network load to a great extent. The remote API can let one or several external applications interact with V-REP in a synchronous* or asynchronous* way (asynchronous by default), and even remote control of the simulator is supported (e.g. remotely loading a scene, starting, pausing or stopping a simulation for instance).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### REMOTE API\n",
    "\n",
    "The remote API functionality comes in 2 separate entities, that are interacting via socket communication:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the client side (i.e. your application): the remote API on the client side is available for many different programming languages. Currently following languages are supported: C/C++, Python, Java, Matlab, Octave and Lua. \n",
    "\n",
    "- the server side (i.e. V-REP): the remote API on the server side is implemented via a V-REP plugin that should be loaded by V-REP by default: v_repExtRemoteApi.dll, libv_repExtRemoteApi.dylib or libv_repExtRemoteApi.so. The plugin project files are located here. Instructions on how to enabled the remote API on the server side are given here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### STARTING THE REMOTE API\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to start the remote API:\n",
    "\n",
    "- At start up the simulator looks for a file named **remoteApiConnections.txt**, based on the parameters set in the file an appropriate connection will be set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- From within a script. A temporary remote API server service can be started or stopped with following 2 custom Lua functions (the 2 functions are exported by the plugin): \n",
    "    * simRemoteApi.start(port_number)\n",
    "    * simRemoteApi.stop(port_number)\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### LOOKING AT A SCRIPT TO INTERACT WITH V-REP REMOTELY\n",
    "\n",
    "**simpleTest.py**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LOOKING AT THE PIONEER 3DX\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"robot-mobile-pioneer-3-dx.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Pioneer 3 DX is a compact differential-drive mobile robot. It arrives fully assembled with embedded controller, motors with 500-tick encoders, 19cm wheels, tough aluminum body, 8 forward-facing ultrasonic (sonar) sensors, 8 optional rear-facing sonar, 1, 2 or 3 hot-swappable batteries, and our complete software development kit. Add an optional internal computer or your own laptop and the robot is ready to go.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Additional sensors, manipulators and other accessories are available to customize your Pioneer for your specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pioneer_manipulator.jpeg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PIONEER IN V-REP\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DIFFERENTIAL WHEEL DRIVE\n",
    "\n",
    "A differential wheeled robot is a mobile robot whose movement is based on two separately driven wheels placed on either side of the robot body. It can thus change its direction by varying the relative rate of rotation of its wheels and hence does not require an additional steering motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### FIND: the mathematical derivation for the differential drive\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LOOKING AT A SCRIPT TO INTERACT WITH V-REP REMOTELY AND CONTROL THE ROBOT\n",
    "\n",
    "**testDrive.py**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## NEXT SESSION\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add at least two sensors to the robot and print out its data.\n",
    "* Braitenberg algorithm for obstacle aviodance\n",
