    "## INTRODUCTION TO V-REP\n",
    "\n",
    "V-REP is a powerful 3D robot simulator, which features several versatile calculation modules (inverse kinematics, Physics/dynamics, collision detections, minimum distance calculations, path planning, etc.), a distributed control architecture (unlimited number of control scripts, threaded or non threaded), and several extension mechanisms (plug-ins, custom client application, etc.).It offers a multitude of functionalities that can be easily integrated and combined through an exhaustive API and script functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "V-REP is the tool for fast prototyping and verification, remote monitoring, fast algorithm development, robotics related education, and simulation of factory automation systems. A V-REP plug-in was specifically developed to allow an intuitive, easy and realistic Khepera robot simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "On V-REP's homepage the program is described as\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"the Swiss army knife among robot simulators: you won't find a simulator with more functions, features, or more elaborate APIs.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "V-REP's strength comes from several features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. V-REP provides a unified framework combining many powerful internal and external libraries that are often useful for robotics simulations.\n",
    "2. V-REP is highly extensible.\n",
    "3. V-REP is cross-platform, mostly open-source, and provides a free educational license.\n",
    "\n",
    "### INTERACTION WITH V-REP\n",
    "\n",
    "#### V-REP GUI INTERFACE\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"userInterface.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to interact with the V-REP simulator, they are through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. REGULAR V-REP API: These are all functions that can either be called directly from a custom C/C++ plugin or through a Lua embedded script.  V-REP functions and constants can easily be recognized from their \"sim\"- or \"_sim\"-prefix (e.g. sim.handleCollision)\n",
    "http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/helpFiles/en/apiOverview.htm\n",
    "\n",
    "2. REMOTE V-REP API: this  is how V-REP enables scripts and programs written in other languages (MATLAB, Java, Python, etc.) to interact with a V-REP simulation from an external application or a remote hardware (e.g. real robot, remote computer, etc.). The remote API functions are interacting with V-REP via socket communication (or, optionally, via shared memory) in a way that reduces lag and network load to a great extent. The remote API can let one or several external applications interact with V-REP in a synchronous* or asynchronous* way (asynchronous by default), and even remote control of the simulator is supported (e.g. remotely loading a scene, starting, pausing or stopping a simulation for instance).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### REMOTE API\n",
    "\n",
    "The remote API functionality comes in 2 separate entities, that are interacting via socket communication:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the client side (i.e. your application): the remote API on the client side is available for many different programming languages. Currently following languages are supported: C/C++, Python, Java, Matlab, Octave and Lua. \n",
    "\n",
    "- the server side (i.e. V-REP): the remote API on the server side is implemented via a V-REP plugin that should be loaded by V-REP by default: v_repExtRemoteApi.dll, libv_repExtRemoteApi.dylib or libv_repExtRemoteApi.so. The plugin project files are located here. Instructions on how to enabled the remote API on the server side are given here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### STARTING THE REMOTE API\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to start the remote API:\n",
    "\n",
    "- At start up the simulator looks for a file named **remoteApiConnections.txt**, based on the parameters set in the file an appropriate connection will be set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- From within a script. A temporary remote API server service can be started or stopped with following 2 custom Lua functions (the 2 functions are exported by the plugin): \n",
    "    * simRemoteApi.start(port_number)\n",
    "    * simRemoteApi.stop(port_number)\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### LOOKING AT A SCRIPT TO INTERACT WITH V-REP REMOTELY\n",
