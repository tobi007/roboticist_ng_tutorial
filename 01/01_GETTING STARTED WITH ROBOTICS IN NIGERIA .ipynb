    "### WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW\n",
    "\n",
    "Robotics spans multiple scientific and engineering disciplines, so when you want to design a better robot you should get some basic knowledge in these fields. How much you should learn depends on how complex you want to make your robot.\n",
    "You don't need to know everything about all of these subjects, however knowing the basics of each of these fields can help in building better robots and prevent you from making (some of the) beginner's mistakes.\n",

    "### GETTING STATRTED\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways to get started with robotics, and they can be divided into two\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using real hardware (experimentation)\n",
    "\n",
    "    This involves shopping online or visiting the local store to get components and start building the robot. This is a very good way to get started with robotics because you will get to build robots that can interact with the real world, and if you love challenges like why is this component behaving like you will get it too, but it is not encouraged. As you will encounter during this process a lot of challenges listed below:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Cost of compponents might be expensive for you at the moment\n",
    "    * After purchase of it might take a very long time to get to you\n",
    "    * Because you are just starting, most of what you will be doing is experimentation by so doing you mignt damage that expensive component\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Using simulation \n",
    "\n",
    "    This involves the use of specialized software to run robots program, you model the robot or use existing models of robots created by the people or the robotics software company. Getting started with robotics using robotics is the best, because it avoids the challenges listed in the using real hardware and more. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Also the stage in which robotics is now, most of the hardware challenges have been conqured like fast, cheap, light weight computer, cheap sensors, variety of sensors. But the challenge now is how do we combine some or all of these sensors to do awesome and amazing stuffs that will add value to  the human life.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ROBOTICS SIMULATION SOFTWARE\n",
    "\n",
    "A robotics simulator is used to create application for a physical robot without depending on the actual machine, thus saving cost and time. In some case, these applications can be transferred onto the physical robot (or rebuilt) without modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to get started using simulation, either you use an online simulation platform or run the simulation software on your computer (virtual machine). The notable platform are listed below.\n",

    "\n",
    "Robotics middleware is middleware to be used in complex robot control software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robotic middleware is designed to manage the complexity and heterogeneity of the hardware and applications, promote the integration of new technologies, simplify software design, hide the complexity of low-level communication and the sensor heterogeneity of the sensors, improve software quality, reuse robotic software infrastructure across multiple research efforts, and to reduce production costs.\n",
